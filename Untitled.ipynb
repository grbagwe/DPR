This flow resistance, often expressed as a dimensionless parameter, formula_10, is related to the discharge coefficient through the equation: which may be obtained by substituting formula_9 in the aforementioned equation with the resistance, formula_10, multiplied by the dynamic pressure of the fluid, formula_14. Due to complex behavior of fluids around some of the structures such as orifices, gates, and weirs etc., some assumptions are made for the theoretical analysis of the stage-discharge relationship.
